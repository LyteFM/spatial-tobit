| Access_Con         | Access_Control         | 1 Full Access Control      Preference given to through traffic movements by providing interchanges   with selected       public roads, and by prohibiting crossing at-grade and direct driveway   connections (i.e.,       limited access to the facility).      2 Partial Access Control      Preference given to through traffic movement.  In addition to interchanges, there may         be some crossings at-grade with public roads, but, direct private driveway   connections       have been minimized through the use of frontage roads or other local access         restrictions.  Control of curb cuts   is not access control.      3 No Access Control No degree of access control exists (i.e., full access   to the facility is permitted). |                                                              |

| PSR                | PSR                    | Present Serviceability Rating (PSR) for   pavement condition.: For investment requirements modeling to estimate   pavement deterioration, section deficiencies,       and  needed  improvements,  in    cost  allocation  studies,    in  pavement  condition    trends,  and  for       other analysis purposes including NHS performance.   Also, for performance measure calculation         for pavement condition on the NHS. | PSR Description      4.0 – 5.0      Only new (or nearly new) superior pavements are likely to be smooth enough   and distress free (sufficiently       free of cracks and patches) to qualify for this category. Most pavements   constructed or resurfaced during       the data year would normally be rated in this category.      3.0 – 4.0      Pavements in this category, although not quite as smooth as those described   above, give a first class ride       and exhibit few, if any, visible signs of surface deterioration. Flexible   pavements may be beginning to show       evidence of rutting and fine random cracks. Rigid pavements may be   beginning to show evidence of slight       surface deterioration, such as minor cracks and spalling.      2.0 – 3.0      The riding qualities of pavements in this category are noticeably inferior   to those of new pavements, and       may be barely tolerable for high-speed traffic. Surface defects of flexible   pavements may include rutting,       map cracking, and extensive patching. Rigid pavements in this group may   have a few joint failures, faulting       and/or cracking, and some pumping.      1.0 – 2.0      Pavements in this category have deteriorated to such an Extent that they   affect the speed of free-flow       traffic. Flexible pavement may have large potholes and deep cracks.   Distress includes raveling, cracking,       rutting and occurs over 50 percent of the surface. Rigid pavement distress   includes joint spalling, patching,       cracking, scaling, and may include pumping and faulting.      0.1 – 1.0      Pavements in this category are in an extremely deteriorated condition. The   facility is passable only at       reduced speeds, and with considerable ride discomfort. Large potholes and   deep cracks exist. Distress       occurs over 75 percent or more of the surface. |
